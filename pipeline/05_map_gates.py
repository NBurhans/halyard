HALYARD / target SABLE — map gating from the creator's walkthrough.

The source tree encodes which flag gates each checkpoint, but not which MAP the
player can reach at which checkpoint — only 11 of 127 encounter maps could be
dated from item placements, leaving 61.8% of the ladder with unknown timing.

VISION 7.4 puts the hack's own website at priority 3, for exactly this: ordering
and progression context that source does not encode. So the ordering below is
read off the creator-provided walkthrough at <target site — see target config> and the
region layout it walks through.

CONFIDENCE. This is NOT Measured and NOT Derived. Every gate here is `Asserted`
— taken from a secondary source without source confirmation — and every row
says so. Where source already derived a gate for a map, the two are compared and
any disagreement is logged as a finding rather than silently overwritten
(VISION 7.4: "the decompilation always wins").

WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN. `earliest_cp = N` means: by the time the player clears
checkpoint N, this map is reachable. The walkthrough gives a linear order, so
these are the first checkpoint at which the walkthrough has the player standing
there. Optional detours the walkthrough mentions as skippable ("you can do this
at any point") are dated to the earliest point it says they are possible.
